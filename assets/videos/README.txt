Place your MP4/WEBM video files here (e.g. demo.mp4). The gallery in index.html will look for video sources in the data-src attribute of the video gallery item.

If you don't have a local video, you can use a remote sample URL. Example remote sample used previously:
https://interactive-examples.mdn.mozilla.net/media/cc0-videos/flower.mp4

To add a local video example:
1. Put `demo.mp4` in this folder.
2. Update index.html gallery item data-src to `assets/videos/demo.mp4`.

Notes: Keep videos under ~10-20MB for fast loading, or host them externally (YouTube/Vimeo) and embed with an iframe instead.
